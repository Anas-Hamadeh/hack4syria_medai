Due to technical issues preventing the use of my available tool for internet searching, I recommend consulting medical databases such as PubMed, Cochrane, and guidelines from major cardiology associations (e.g., ACC, ESC) to gather evidence-based information on Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT), Atrial Fibrillation, and Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs), as well as validating lifestyle management recommendations related to caffeine intake and stress reduction.
