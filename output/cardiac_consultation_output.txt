Given the patient's symptoms, a comprehensive cardiac evaluation is paramount to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective management. 

1. **Specific Cardiac Diagnosis or Differential Diagnoses:**
   - *Primary Diagnosis:* Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT) is highly suspected due to the episodic nature of rapid heart rate, triggers like stress, caffeine, exercise, and the positive response to the Valsalva maneuver.
   - *Differential Diagnoses:* Consider atrial fibrillation or flutter due to potential irregular rhythm and the triggers involved. Anxiety-induced palpitations are possible but unlikely as primary, given the pattern and response to interventions.
   - *Additional Consideration:* Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs), although less likely due to the sustained nature of the palpitations described.

2. **Recommended Cardiac Tests or Monitoring:**
   - An ECG to capture the electrical activity of the heart, particularly during a palpitation episode.
   - A Holter monitor or event monitor for continuous tracking can help document the episodes over a period to correlate symptoms with cardiac rhythm.
   - An Echocardiogram to assess heart structure and rule out underlying pathologies that may contribute to arrhythmias.

3. **Treatment Recommendations:**
   - Advise reducing caffeine intake and managing stress to evaluate their impact on symptom frequency and severity.
   - Consider continuing the use of the Valsalva maneuver when episodes occur to provide temporary relief.
   - Based on monitoring results, further treatment options might include medications such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, or in severe cases, an electrophysiological study followed by radiofrequency ablation if indicated.

4. **Urgency Level:**
   - The condition does not seem to require immediate emergency care due to the spontaneous resolution of episodes and absence of severe symptoms. However, an expedited specialist assessment is advised to prevent potential future complications.

5. **Follow-Up Requirements:**
   - Follow-up with a cardiologist should occur promptly to initiate the recommended diagnostic tests and establish a personalized management plan.
   - Regular follow-up appointments will be necessary to adjust treatment based on the response and any new findings from diagnostic testing.

6. **Specific Cardiac Risk Factors Identified:**
   - High consumption of caffeine is a modifiable risk factor influencing palpitations. 
   - Stress is an additional factor needing management through lifestyle adjustments or therapeutic interventions, as applicable.

Given this structured approach, we aim for an optimal balance of diagnostic accuracy, effective intervention, and prevention strategies to ensure comprehensive cardiac care and enhance patient outcomes.
