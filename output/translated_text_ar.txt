Doctor, I am experiencing rapid and sudden heart palpitations, as if it is beating very quickly for no apparent reason. This has been occurring frequently over the past few months, sometimes lasting for several minutes, and sometimes for more than an hour. When this happens, I feel slightly dizzy, and sometimes there is shortness of breath, but it does not reach the point of fainting. It started about 6 months ago. I've noticed that it often happens when I'm stressed or after drinking coffee or exercising, but sometimes it comes on suddenly even when I'm relaxed. Then it returns to normal suddenly. I have no previous history of heart disease, and I have not suffered from high blood pressure or diabetes. I do not take any daily medications, but sometimes I take headache relievers like paracetamol. I do not smoke, but I drink coffee daily, about two or three cups. I do not drink alcohol. I do not feel chest pain, but sometimes when the palpitations are severe, I feel slight shortness of breath and slight sweating. I have never lost consciousness. Sometimes when I hold my breath and try to take a deep breath, the palpitations ease slightly. I read about the Valsalva maneuver and tried it, and sometimes it helps stop the episode.
