**Diagnostic Assessment**

1. **Prioritized Differential Diagnoses:**
   - *Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT):* High confidence. The episodes of rapid heart rate, response to Valsalva maneuver, and stress or caffeine as potential triggers are characteristic of PSVT.
   - *Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter:* Moderate confidence. The sudden onset and offset of palpitations could suggest atrial fibrillation or a similar atrial arrhythmia, but the description leans more towards PSVT due to lack of continuous irregular heart rhythm.
   - *Anxiety/Panic Attacks:* Moderate confidence. Though anxiety can cause palpitations, the described episodes and physiological responses are more indicative of a cardiac cause.
   - *Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs):* Lower confidence. These could cause palpitations, but typically do not present with sustained rapid heart rate and associated symptoms as described.

2. **Urgency Assessment:**
   - The patient's condition does not appear immediately life-threatening due to the absence of persistent symptoms, loss of consciousness, or severe shortness of breath. However, continued monitoring and diagnostic evaluations are critical due to the recurring nature and potential for progression.

3. **Recommendation for Specialist Referral:**
   - **Cardiology:** Strongly recommended for further investigation. An evaluation by a cardiologist should include:
     - An ECG (Electrocardiogram) during an episode if feasible.
     - A Holter monitor or event monitor to capture arrhythmias over an extended period.
     - Possible Echocardiogram to assess cardiac function and structure.

4. **Rationale:**
   - The symptoms and triggers align with a form of supraventricular tachycardia, requiring a professional evaluation to rule out other arrhythmias and plan management or intervention.
   - While less likely, the possibility of atrial fibrillation or underlying structural heart issues should be explored to ensure comprehensive care and prevention of complications.

5. **Treatment and Lifestyle Recommendations:**
   - Initial advice to reduce caffeine intake and manage stress could help alleviate symptoms.
   - Continue with non-pharmacological interventions like the Valsalva maneuver as needed for palpitations.
   - If palpitations continue or worsen, pharmacologic treatment or procedural interventions might be recommended by the specialist based on further diagnostic findings.

This approach balances immediate safety with the need for thorough investigation to prevent potential progression and manage the condition effectively.
